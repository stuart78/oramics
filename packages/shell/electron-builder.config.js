/**
 * electron-builder configuration.
 *
 * This lives in a script rather than package.json so signing can depend on
 * whether credentials are actually present. A static config that always asks
 * for a hardened runtime fails outright on a machine with no certificate, which
 * would mean nobody could build the app without an Apple account.
 *
 * Three states, all of which produce a working build:
 *
 *   no certificate      unsigned, same as before. Gatekeeper needs the
 *                       right-click Open workaround on other machines.
 *   certificate only    signed and hardened, but not notarised. Still blocked
 *                       on a machine that has never seen the app.
 *   certificate + notary  signed, hardened and stapled. Opens normally.
 *
 * Set CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false to force an unsigned build even when a
 * certificate is available, which is faster for local iteration.
