/**
 * Importing a MIDI file.
 *
 * Parsing is one thing and laying the result on the machine is another, so they
 * are separate: `smf.ts` turns bytes into notes and controllers, `perform.ts`
 * decides what a machine with one pitch strip and four timbres can do with them.
 * The second is where the opinions live.
 *
 * No DOM and no Node, like the engine and the vision package, so the same code
 * runs in the app and in a test.
