/**
 * Laying a MIDI file onto the machine.
 *
 * This is the part with opinions in it, because the machine is not a synth that
 * happens to lack polyphony. It has one pitch strip and four amplitude strips,
 * and the four amplitudes are the four timbres of a single voice, not four
 * voices. A chord cannot be represented at all. Neither can two parts at
 * different pitches.
 *
 * So a file is reduced to one line. The highest sounding note wins by default,
 * which is what a listener hears as the tune, and everything under it becomes
 * silence rather than something the sheet cannot say. That is a real loss and
 * the importer reports it rather than hiding it.
 *
 * What the other lanes get:
 *
 *   amplitude   the sounding note's velocity, in the timbre belonging to the
 *               part it came from, so an arrangement moving between parts
 *               changes timbre the way Oram would have by hand
 *   vibrato     the modulation wheel, or the pitch bend where there is no wheel
 *   reverb      the reverb send, CC 91
 *
 * Nothing is written to the transport strip. A blank transport is normal speed,
 * and a MIDI file has already had its tempo baked into the note times.
