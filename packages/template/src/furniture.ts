 * Where the sheet prints its own ink inside the drawing areas.
 *
 * An extractor looking at a scan cannot tell a printed rule from a pen stroke by
 * looking at it. Most of the template is light enough to fall below any sane ink
 * threshold, but three things are not: the band borders, the centre rails on the
 * bipolar lanes, and the little rail labels tucked inside each band. Left alone,
 * the centre rail on the vibrato lane reads as a line somebody drew across the
 * whole thirty seconds.
 *
 * This lives here rather than in the vision package because it is a fact about
 * what `render.ts` draws, and the two have to move together. The regions are
 * deliberately positional: a column is only ignored at the heights the template
 * actually printed something, so a stroke drawn through the same column at a
 * different height still reads.
