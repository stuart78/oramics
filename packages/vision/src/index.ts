/**
 * Importing a scanned or photographed sheet.
 *
 * The other half of the workshop loop. You could already draw, hear and print;
 * this is the part that reads the paper back. Somebody marks up a printed sheet
 * by hand, you photograph it, and the marks come back as lanes indistinguishable
 * from ones drawn on screen.
 *
 * Three steps, each of which can fail honestly:
 *
 *   register   find the four corner squares, solve the map onto page space
 *   describe   read the QR, so the sheet says what it is and how long it lasts
 *   extract    sample every band and panel where the template says they are
 *
 * The package has no DOM and no Node, like the engine, so the same code runs in
 * the renderer against a canvas, in a unit test against a rendered sheet, and in
 * a watch folder later.
