/**
 * The reverberation strip's destination.
 *
 * Strip 9 controlled how much of the four-timbre mix went to reverb. What it
 * went *to* is not recorded in the sources I have — a Radiophonic Workshop room
 * of that period would have had a plate, a spring, an echo chamber and tape
 * delay available, and Oram's own studio at Tower Folly was her own equipment.
 * So this is a plate: the most likely candidate, the most characteristic of the
 * era, and the one whose sound is least like a modern algorithmic reverb.
 *
 * A Dattorro tank — input diffusers feeding a figure-of-eight of delays with
 * damping and modulated taps. Modulation matters: an unmodulated tank rings on
 * sustained tones, and this instrument holds notes for a long time.
